**An iOS-themed smartphone for FiveM.** that supports QBOX, QBCORE and ESX, with experimental ox_core support. 49 server-backed apps, real app accounts, a live game-view camera and online multiplayer games. Ships its own custom phone props: eight phone items in eight colours, each tinting both the on-screen frame and the custom prop model held in hand. A unique phone system as well as sim cards can be enabled!

**A drop-in lb-phone replacement.** Scripts and custom apps written against lb-phone's exports and events keep running unmodified, and a first-boot migration carries your players across rather than resetting them: phone numbers and lock passcodes, contacts, blocked numbers, call history, SMS threads including groups and reactions, photos and albums, notes, phone settings, mail accounts with their inboxes, wallet transaction history, voice memos, Photogram and Birdy accounts with their posts, stories, DMs and followers, and the app logins themselves, so players open the phone already signed in.

If sd-phone is useful to you, please ⭐ the repo. Issues and pull requests are always welcome.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is production ready.** sd-phone is ready to run on a live server — there should be
> no blatant issues with the phone as it stands today.
>
> The version number is not a warning about stability. It sits below 1.0.0 because 1.0.0 is

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Coming from lb-phone? Give the first boot time to finish.**
> sd-phone imports your lb-phone data on its first-ever startup. On a large database that is not instant: a production import of **3.8 million rows took roughly 8 minutes**, and the server stays busy until it completes. The console prints the row count, a time estimate and per-domain progress, so you can tell it is working rather than hung. Let it run to the end.
>
> This only happens once. Every later restart skips the domains that are already imported, so normal startups are unaffected.

> [!TIP]
> **Want a tablet? Check out the companion tablet, [sd-tablet](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-tablet).**
> A second device for the same character, running these same apps on a bigger screen. Same messages,
> same contacts, same accounts, same wallet, because there is one set of player data and both devices
> read it. No pairing, no sync, no second phone to configure.
>
> It is a companion resource and needs sd-phone to run. [More below](#companion-sd-tablet).

### sd-phone is partnered with Fivemanage for media hosting

The Camera, Photos and Voice Memos apps need somewhere to store what they capture. sd-phone uses **[Fivemanage](https://refer.fivemanage.com/samuel)** for that: every screenshot, camera video and voice recording uploads to Fivemanage and comes back as a fast CDN URL, so you never run your own media server. It is the CDN and logging platform trusted by thousands of FiveM servers.

**A free Fivemanage Media API token is required for photo, video and voice-note uploads to work.** In the Fivemanage dashboard open the Tokens tab, create a token of type **Media**, and paste it into `configs/server/apikeys.lua` under `FivemanageMedia`. Without a key the camera and recorders still open, but nothing uploads or saves.

<sub>The free tier is plenty for most servers.</sub>

## Home screen widgets

Eleven widgets, each in three sizes (2x2, 4x2 and 4x4), added from the Add Widget sheet in edit mode and placed anywhere on any page.

| Widget | Shows |
|---|---|
| **Weather** | Current conditions coloured by the in-game sky, hourly strip, and a five-day forecast with temperature range bars |

Nine of them offer a **Dark, Light or Glass** finish; Glass frosts your wallpaper behind the tile. Weather and Now Playing take their colour from their content instead. Clock and Weather also align left, centre or right. Previews in the picker render over your own wallpaper at true size, so what you see is what gets placed.

## Companion: sd-tablet

<div align="center">

### [sd-tablet](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-tablet) is a tablet for the same character

[![sd-tablet](https://img.shields.io/badge/sd--tablet-companion%20resource-94DD0C?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-tablet)

</div>

A second device your players can carry, running **this** phone's apps on a bigger screen. It is a
companion resource, not a separate phone: it ships no apps, no database tables and no server logic
of its own, and it renders sd-phone's own `web/src` against a tablet device profile, so there is
exactly one copy of the interface and it cannot drift.

Everything is shared because nothing is copied. One set of player data on this server, two devices
reading it: the same Messages threads, contacts, mail, notes, photos, app logins, wallet, settings
and passcode. There is no pairing step and no sync, because there is nothing to sync.

The tablet cannot **place or answer voice calls**. That refusal is enforced here, in
`client/companion.lua`, on sd-phone's side of the seam, so it holds even for a modified tablet
build. Home screen arrangement is the one thing the two devices keep separately, since a layout's
page boundaries are that device's own grid.

Requires sd-phone, and only works alongside it. Install it next to this resource and `ensure` it
after: [github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-tablet](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-tablet)

## Highlights

- **Real accounts engine.** Social apps use actual registration and login, with verification codes and password resets delivered by in-game mail or SMS. Accounts are global, not per-character-slot.
- **Live game-view camera.** The Camera app renders the world into the phone screen in real time; video clips record your microphone and nearby players' voices.
- **Photogram Live.** Stream real encoded video to other players' phones, with clean late-joins.
- **Deep world integration.** Garages and Homes bridge across ten-plus garage and housing systems; Wallet reads your framework bank; Services maps jobs to callable, messageable companies; Weather mirrors the in-game sky.
- **Custom apps.** Other resources can put their own apps on the phone: one export call turns any webpage into an installable app with icons, badges, notifications, popups and an App Store listing. Custom apps built for lb-phone run unmodified. Start from the [app templates](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-app-templates) (plain JS, React JS/TS, Vue 3, Svelte 5) and the [custom app guide](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/custom-apps).
- **lb-phone drop-in compatibility.** Third-party scripts written against lb-phone's exports and events keep working unmodified, and a one-command migrator imports lb-phone player data. See the [compatibility docs](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/lb-phone-compatibility).

## For developers

The phone ships a full integration surface, documented at [docs.samueldev.shop](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/):

- [Server exports](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/exports-server) for sending mail, messages and notifications, starting calls, managing contacts, resolving numbers to players, logging transactions, posting news, and more.
- [Client exports](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/exports-client) for opening the phone, deep-linking into apps, and gating phone use.
- [Custom apps](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/custom-apps) for shipping your own apps on the phone, with ready-made [templates](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-app-templates) for plain JS, React, Vue and Svelte. Apps written for lb-phone register and run unmodified.
- [First-party events](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/events-server) on every lifecycle moment: messages, mail, calls, transactions, posts, contacts.
- [lb-phone compatibility](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/lb-phone-compatibility) covering exports, events, and `dependency 'lb-phone'` lines.

```lua
-- A taste: text a player from a job script
exports['sd-phone']:sendSystemMessage('555-0199', 'LS Dispatch', targetNumber, 'New tow request at Legion Square.')

-- React to any SMS being sent
AddEventHandler('sd-phone:server:messages:sent', function(m)
    print(('%s texted %s'):format(m.senderNumber, m.targetNumber))
end)
```

## Compatibility

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Grab the packaged **`sd-phone-*.zip`** from the [latest release](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone/releases).
> The green **Code → Download ZIP** button gives you source only, with no `web/build/`, and the phone will open blank.

### Dependencies

| Resource | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| [ox_lib](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_lib) | Shared library. **v3.39.0 or newer recommended** |
| [oxmysql](https://github.com/CommunityOx/oxmysql) | Database access |
| [sd-phone-props](https://github.com/Samuels-Development/sd-phone-props) | Streams the in-hand phone models |

### 1. Start the resources

Extract `sd-phone` and `sd-phone-props` into your resources folder, then start them after their dependencies:

```cfg
ensure ox_lib
ensure oxmysql
ensure sd-phone-props
ensure sd-phone
```

Database tables create themselves on first boot.

### 2. Add the phone items

One item per frame colour:

```
phone_black   phone_blue     phone_green   phone_orange
phone_pink    phone_purple   phone_red     phone_yellow
```

Ready-made ox_inventory definitions live in the [installation docs](https://docs.samueldev.shop/resources/phone/installation), and the item icons ship in this repo's `images/` folder.

**On ESX with no separate inventory resource, this step is automatic.** ESX keeps its item catalogue in the `items` database table, and an item missing from it can never be given or used, so the phone would register correctly and still refuse to open. sd-phone adds the missing rows on boot and refreshes ESX's catalogue in place, no restart needed. Turn it off with `SeedEsxItems = false` in `configs/phone.lua` and import `sql/esx_items.sql` yourself instead. Servers running ox_inventory, qs, tgiann or codem are untouched: define the items in that inventory as usual.

Players can also open the phone with a keybind (<kbd>F1</kbd> by default), which still requires owning one of these items.

Running unique phones with physical SIM trays (`SimTray` in `configs/uniqueandsim.lua`, ox_inventory only)? Give every phone item a `buttons` entry so players can open its tray:

```lua
buttons = {
    { label = 'SIM Tray', action = function(slot) exports['sd-phone']:openSimTray(slot) end },
},
```

Using the phone item opens the phone itself, so the tray needs its own button. Skip this in metadata mode, where SIMs are installed by using the `sim_card` item.

### 3. Add your API keys

In `configs/server/apikeys.lua`:

| Key | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| `FivemanageMedia` | **Required.** Camera, Photos and Voice Memos uploads. Create a free [Fivemanage](https://refer.fivemanage.com/samuel) token of type **Media**. Without it those apps open, but nothing uploads or saves. |
| `Giphy` | Optional. The GIF picker in Messages. Free key from [developers.giphy.com](https://developers.giphy.com). |

### Building from source

Cloned the repo instead of using a release? Build the UI yourself:

```bash
cd web
npm ci
npm run build
```

The output lands in the gitignored `web/build/`, and the server logs a clear error on boot if it is missing.
