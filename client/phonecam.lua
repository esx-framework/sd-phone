local HEAD_BONE <const> = 31086
---@type integer SKEL_ROOT bone tag, the pelvis. Only used to measure how far the head has swung off

---(0.7 cm of differential) and anchoring there just lets the whole player bob through a still frame.
local ROOT_BONE <const> = 0
---@type number How much of the head's sway off the torso the lens follows. The head really does
---travel ~9 cm sideways over the shoulders in GTA's walk cycle, and one rigid camera point cannot

local RISE <const> = 0.05
---@type number Metres the selfie lens sits out in front of the face. Held further out than an arm
---naturally reaches because the residual sway is a TRANSLATION, so the angle it subtends falls off
---linearly with distance: the same 9 cm of sway is 9.2 degrees at 0.55 m and 3.4 degrees at 0.75 m.
---SELFIE_FOV is narrowed to match, so the framing is unchanged and only the shake shrinks. Much past

local LOOK_LR <const> = 1

local SELFIE_PITCH_LIMIT <const> = 45.0
---@type number Selfie field of view. Narrowed from 60 to hold the SAME framing now the lens sits at
---0.75 m instead of 0.55: 2*atan(tan(30 deg) * 0.55/0.75). Change one of these and the other has to
---move with it or the shot re-crops.
local SELFIE_FOV <const> = 46.0

---movement throws the frame off the subject.
local MIN_FOV <const> = 10.0
