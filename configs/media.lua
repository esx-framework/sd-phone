-- The media relay: a WebSocket that carries live video straight between the browser producing it
-- and the browsers watching it, instead of pushing every frame through the game's event bus.
--
-- Nothing in here decides who may watch anything. The features that own a stream (the MDT's
-- Cameras section, Photogram Live, Vibez Live) run exactly the permission checks they run today,
-- and only once one has passed does this layer sign a short-lived token saying so. A token is a
-- receipt for a decision already made, never a substitute for making one.
--
-- The relay itself is a small Node process you run separately. It is not a FiveM resource, it is
-- not started by this one, and it never talks to the game: it only knows stream names and the
-- tokens this server signs. It needs a hostname with a publicly trusted certificate, because the
-- phone's UI runs on a secure origin: the browser refuses a plain ws:// endpoint outright, and a
-- self-signed certificate fails with close code 1006 and no prompt for the player to accept.
--
-- The URL and the signing key are read from server convars, never from this file, so a secret
-- cannot land in a git diff. Put them in your server.cfg:
--     set sd_phone_relay_url "wss://media.example.com/ws"
--     set sd_phone_relay_key "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"
--     set sd_phone_relay_ttl "45"
--     set sd_phone_relay_control_url "https://media.example.com/control"
-- Only the first two are needed; the last two fall back to TokenTtlSeconds below and to a control
-- endpoint derived from the relay URL. Generate a key with `openssl rand -hex 32` and give the
-- same 64 characters to the relay process as its SD_PHONE_RELAY_KEY environment variable. The key
-- is specific to the relay: rotating it rotates nothing else, and the relay is never handed the
-- server secret that configs/server and .secret protect.
--
-- With either convar unset, with the Node crypto helper missing, or with Enabled below false, the
-- whole thing reports itself unavailable and every feature keeps streaming the way it does today.
-- That is the shipped default, so an install that never sets a convar never notices this file.
return {

    -- (sd_phone_relay_ttl) overrides this when set.
